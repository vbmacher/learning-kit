# Learning Kit

I am software engineer, and I have started learning programming in 1996, at age of 12.
My first computer was [IBM PS/2 Model 55SX with Intel 80386 SX](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/alf/ps2_55sx/), which I got from my aunt.

NOTE: At the time, I was "observing" stuff installed on my computer without internet, and I
      took many journeys, experiments, which often led to "broken computer".

In years, my ways of learning had improved, but I still think that playing is the fastest
way to learn. Playing should be the first experience, theory should follow next.

## Who is this site for

Mostly, it serves for HRs or companies I am applying for. This repository contains sample
code using various technologies or algorithms which might be required for the job.

Here I present only stuff which I developed myself, it's not copy-pasted code.

## What can be found here

At root you can see several sub-directories which represent some categories. The categories are
mostly online sites which offer some public online assignments (courses) or challenges. Under
particular subdirectory can be found solutions for problems/courses where I have participated:

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [EdX](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
- [Codility](https://codility.com/programmers/)
- [LambdaConf 2018](https://github.com/vbmacher/learning-kit/tree/master/lambdaconf-2018) - Notes, excercises, workshops
- Other ([Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/), etc.)

## Toy projects

Directory `projects` contains standalone "toy" projects, which are not bound with any
organization or some online course. For example:
