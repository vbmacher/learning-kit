 - We are going to write a binary search algorithm, which returns a Writer, so we can record the intermediate steps.
 -
 - The signature of our binary search is as follows:
 - binarySearch :: (Show a, Ord a, Eq a, Monoid b) => (a -> a -> b) -> a -> [a] -> Writer b Bool
 - 
 - A breakdown of the function parameters:
 -   - (a -> a -> b) : A function which is called on each comparison, passing in the search value, and the value to compare in the list. It returns a monoid value, which is used in the Writer
 -   - a : The value we are hunting for
 -   - [a] : The list we are searching for the value, assumed to be ordered low to high
 -   - Writer b Bool : The return value of the Writer will be a monoid, constructed on each (recursive) search step, and a Bool value, whether we found the value in our list
 -
 - The pattern for the gcd' function in the chapter is helpful. That is: pattern match, guard and using tell and return in the do notation.
 -   
 - Note, There appear to have been some changes to ghc since Learn You a Haskell was written. There is no data constructor exposed for Writer, like described in the chapter. You cannot do things like: logNumber x = Writer (x, ["Got number: " ++ show x]). However there is a 'writer' function, which works in the same way as that constructor would. That is, you could do: logNumber x = writer (x, ["Got number: " ++ show x]). For more information, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11684321/how-to-play-with-control-monad-writer-in-haskell
 - That said, it is possible to create the Writers necessary for this exercise using only return and tell.
 -
 - It may help to write a function first, "describe", which returns a description of the comparison at each step. This function would return a single element list of type String (remember, lists are monoids). Such a function could run as follows:
 -
 - ghci> runWriter $ binarySearch describe 5 [1..10]
 - (True,["5 is less than 6","5 is greater than 3","5 is greater than 4","5 is equal to 5"])
 -
 - Or, perhaps a little clearer:
 - ghci> mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter $ binarySearch describe 5 [1..10]
 - 5 is less than 6
 - 5 is greater than 3
 - 5 is greater than 4
 - 5 is equal to 5

import Control.Monad.Writer

describe :: (Show a, Eq a, Ord a) => a -> a -> [String]
describe x y
  | x < y = show x ++ " is less than " ++ show y
  | x > y = show x ++ " is greater than " ++ show y
  | otherwise = show x ++ " is equal to " ++ show y


binarySearch :: (Show a, Ord a, Eq a, Monoid b) => (a -> a -> b) -> a -> [a] -> Writer b Bool
binarySearch f a = do
  

{-
 - Investigate what other functions instead of describe can be passed to the binary search.
 - Is it possible to provide a function, so that when we do the binary search we can return a count of how many comparisons the algorithm took?
