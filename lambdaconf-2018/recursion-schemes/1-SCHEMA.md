## Schemas

We want to build a data ingestion pipeline that's able to accept new data sources without writing any new code. That means that our pipeline will be completely configured by the schema of the data source.

So we'll be manipulating schemas all day long. And schemas are inherently recursive, so you see where this is heading, right? :) 

When you're ready, head on to `src/main/scala/1-prelude.scala` you'll find explanatory comments and many more `TODO` to replace.
