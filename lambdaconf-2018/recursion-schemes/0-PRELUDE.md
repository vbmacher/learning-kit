## Prelude

Our HR department told us that we need to provide new hires with a full week of training, but we decided to shrink that to just one hour.

We'll be using recursion schemes quite intensively for our project, and we've been told that it's a technique that hasn't yet been widely adopted by the industry.

So let's begin our training by a recursion schemes crash course. There will first be a short presentation given by our ~sales manager~ technical lead (seriously, what kind of developer wears a suit and a tie nowadays?). After that, you'll be tasked to solve the exercises under `src/main/scala/0-prelude.scala`.
