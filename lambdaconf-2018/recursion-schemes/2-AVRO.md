## Avro schemas

Avro is a library (that has a Java version) and a data representation format. It is widely used in the data industry as it offers interesting features like schema versioning, automatic data upcast and downcast between schema versions and things like that.

Unfortunately, it has not been designed with functional programming and strong typing in mind, let alone recursion schemes... So our job will be a little harder this time.

You should find relevant hints in the comments in `src/main/scala/2-avro.scala` that'll help you tame that Avro beast.
