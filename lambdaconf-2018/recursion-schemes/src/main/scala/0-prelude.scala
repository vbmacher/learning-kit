// My notes:
//   - explicit recursion is bad (mixed concerns, not reusable code, compiler doesn't help much)
//   - Recursion schemes FTW (https://github.com/slamdata/matryoshka)
//   - Families of schemas:
//     - folds (ex. cata) - destroy a structure bottom up,
//     - unfolds (ex. ana) - builds a structure,
//     - refolds (ex. hylo) - combines unfold then fold  - result is a "unstructured" type
//
// Using recursion schemes => never write recursion yourself!!!
// To use any recursion scheme, you need: Functor, Fix-point, Algebra (and/or co-algebra)
//
// Pattern functors - e.g. tree types might be nested (recursive)
// solution: use a fix-point type to "swallow" recursion
